We will practice with a dataset of **Shakespeare's writing** (from Andrej Karpathy's [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)). We will train a model when given a sequence of characters from this data, that predicts the next character in the sequence. For example, when given the characters 'togethe', trained model will predict 'r' for the next character. Longer sequences of text can be generated by calling the model repeatedly.\n",
